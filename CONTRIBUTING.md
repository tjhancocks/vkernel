# Contributing to vkernel
Thanks for your interest in contributing to vkernel! There is much to do and any
help you want to give will be much appreciated, whether it be submitting issues
and bug reports, fixing typos, small bugs or even entire chunks of 
functionality.

### Getting Started
The first thing you'll need to do is make sure you can actually _compile_ and 
_run_ vkernel. Make sure you have checked out the Veracyon/Toolchain repository
and gone through the instructions there on getting up and running.

To make a contribution you will need to fork the project and create your own 
branch, in which you can make your contributions to. You should then submit a 
pull request back to the main repo.

_All_ pull requests submitted that do not correctly compile and run inside QEMU
will be rejected.
